Today, I embarked on the exciting journey of Android development. One of the first things I decided to delve into was understanding the basics of Kotlin. Kotlin, the preferred language for Android app development,could be a good topup to my Java knowledge. I started with the [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview), a series of exercises that introduce you to the Kotlin language and its features. I completed the first 10 exercises, which covered topics such as basic syntax, control flow, and collections.  

Additionally, I also started the "Modern Android App Architecture" course provided by Google. This course has given me a lot of valuable insights into how to structure an Android app for scalability, maintainability, and testability. Here are some of the key concepts I've studied today:

- [Dependency Injection in Android](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)

- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android): Hilt is a DI library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. It simplifies the implementation of DI and is built on top of the popular DI library [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/), making it even more robust and efficient.

- [Android Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture): Understanding Android Architecture is fundamental to building efficient apps. This involves the application of design patterns like Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), understanding lifecycle-aware components, and how to implement data persistence with Room, among others.

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies the process of UI development on Android with less boilerplate code and a powerful toolkit for building responsive applications.

As I dive deeper into Android development, I expect to cover topics such as handling network requests with Retrofit, managing state with LiveData, and asynchronous programming with Kotlin Coroutines,and possibly build a few apps along the way.
