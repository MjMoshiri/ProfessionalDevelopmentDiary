- **[MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)**: Progressed through two additional sessions and explored the following topics:
    - **Near Misses**: Explored the importance of near misses in the learning process. These instances, which almost fulfill the criteria to be considered correct but fall just short, are crucial for refining AI algorithms and enhancing their decision-making capabilities.
    - **Felicity Conditions**: Delved into the concept of felicity conditions, which are the preconditions necessary for certain actions or statements to be meaningful or appropriate in specific contexts. Understanding these conditions is essential for developing AI systems that can interact effectively in complex social environments.
    - **Support Vector Machines and Kernels**: Gained insights into the science behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and the use of kernel functions. These powerful tools for pattern recognition and classification leverage the concept of hyperplanes and dimensional transformations to maximize the margin between different categories of data.
