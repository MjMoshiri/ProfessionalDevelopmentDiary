Another productive day on the path of learning and applying machine learning concepts. Here's a summary:

- **[Borsuk-Ulam Theorem and Stolen Necklaces Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVqxCSsE7c&t=331s)**: Dived into the fascinating world of mathematical theorems and problems, specifically the Borsuk-Ulam theorem and the stolen necklaces problem and how the two are connected.

- **Mathematics For Machine Learning - Chapter 3**: Successfully finished chapter 3 of the book Mathematics for Machine Learning. This chapter covered Analytic Geometry and sub-topics like:
    - 3.1 Norms 
    - 3.2 Inner Products 
    - 3.3 Lengths and Distances 
    - 3.4 Angles and Orthogonality 
    - 3.5 Orthonormal Basis 
    - 3.6 Orthogonal Complement 
    - 3.7 Inner Product of Functions 
    - 3.8 Orthogonal Projections 
    - 3.9 Rotations 

- **[Kaggle Competitions Repository](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/Kaggle-competitions)**: Initiated a new repository on GitHub to keep track of all my works on Kaggle competitions.

- **[SpaceShip Titanic Competition](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/Kaggle-competitions/blob/master/Spaceship%20Titanic/notebook.ipynb)**: Started the intriguing SpaceShip Titanic competition. Eager to see how this unfolds!
