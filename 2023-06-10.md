Today was a significant day, as I managed to complete the first cycle of my SecondSight app. Here's what I learned:

- **Dispatchers in Kotlin**: I discovered how [dispatchers](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutine-context-and-dispatchers.html) are used in Kotlin to specify the thread or threads a coroutine should run on. This knowledge is critical when dealing with concurrency and parallelism in Kotlin, especially for tasks that require intensive computation or IO operations.

- **Coroutines in Android**: I delved into the use of coroutines in Android development. Coroutines allow for simpler and more readable async code. I recommend checking out this [guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines) to get started with coroutines in Android.

- **Debugging in Android Studio**: I spent some time learning about debugging in Android Studio and how to use Logcat. Debugging is an essential skill for any developer, and understanding how to effectively debug your app can save a lot of time and frustration. More about debugging in Android Studio can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug).

- **Lifecycle of an Android App**: I learned about the lifecycle of an Android app and how to use lifecycle-aware components. Understanding the lifecycle of an app is crucial to making apps that are robust and user-friendly. You can learn more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle).

- **Unit Testing in Android**: I had a brief introduction to
 [unit testing in Android](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing) and different aspects of it in an Android app. I am planning to learn more about this in the coming days and see how I can apply it to my SecondSight app.

- **SecondSight App Progress**: Finally, the first cycle of the SecondSight app is complete! I now have a working app that can track time and display it in a list. I'm excited to continue refining and expanding this project. you can see the project repository [here](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight).
