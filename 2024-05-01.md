Today, I officially started diving into the fascinating world of Quantum, a topic I had been contemplating for a while, Using the Nilsen and Chuang textbook as the beginning point. Here's a summary of what I've covered so far:


- **Recall on Complex Numbers**: Reviewed the foundational concepts of complex numbers, including their representation and operations.

- **[Chi Series and Definition of Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaL_Cb42WyY)**: Explored the Chi series and looked into defining pi through the concept of counting the number of points on the surface of a circle.

- **History of Quantum Mechanics** 

- **Church-Turing Thesis**

- **Quantum Bits (Qubits)**: Learned about the fundamental unit of quantum information, the qubit, including how its state is represented and the impact of measurements on these states.

**Tags**: Quantum, Complex Numbers, Chi Series, Pi, Church-Turing Thesis, Qubits
