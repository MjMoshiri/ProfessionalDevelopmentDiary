- Completed the [MLOps course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-first-machine-operations-workflow/) on Microsoft Learn. Learned to set up environments for different workflow stages and how to register and deploy models to endpoints.

- Contributed to open-source projects over the past days. Gained experience in contributing, interacting with the community, and making pull requests. Looking to improve skills in reading code in large projects and writing documentation. Found this [guide](https://github.com/aredridel/how-to-read-code/blob/master/how-to-read-code.md) useful for understanding code.
