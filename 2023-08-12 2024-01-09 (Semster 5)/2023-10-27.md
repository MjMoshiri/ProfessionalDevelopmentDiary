In the past couple of days, I've been working on my algorithm course project. As we are required to work in C++, I've familiarized myself with the Standard Template Library (STL) and its various algorithms and associated functions. Some of the data structures I've been working with include `multiset`, `deque`. I've also used certain functions such as `sort()`, `find()`, `reverse()`, `lower_bound()`, and `upper_bound()`.

This exposure to C++ and STL has been both challenging and rewarding, deepening my appreciation for the robustness and utility of the language and library.
