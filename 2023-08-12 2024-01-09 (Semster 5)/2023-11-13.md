Now that the logic of my [GitHub.io](https://mjmoshiri.github.io) page is ready, I believe it's the appropriate time to revisit **Java** and develop a more fundamental understanding of the language.

As a result, I have started reading [*The Well-Grounded Java Developer*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-well-grounded-java/9781617298875/), authored by senior developers from Microsoft and RedHat.
