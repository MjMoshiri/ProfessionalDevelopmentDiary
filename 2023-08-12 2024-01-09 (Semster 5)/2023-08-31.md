- Began [Learning Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/) on O'Reilly to establish a best-practice approach to Go.
  
- Finished the initial 3 chapters, new concepts I learned:
  - [Inside the Map Implementation in Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl7mi9QmLns)
  - Anonymous structs

**Tags**: Go, O'Reilly
