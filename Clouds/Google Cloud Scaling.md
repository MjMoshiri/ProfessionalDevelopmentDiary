**[Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Engineer Professional](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/cloud-engineering-gcp)**: Courses 4-6 completed. Key phrases to remember:

## Networking:
- **[HA VPN](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/topologies)**: High Availability VPN that provides an SLA of 99.99% service availability.
- **[BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/border-gateway-protocol/)**: Critical for dynamic routing in cloud network architectures.
- **[VPC Peering](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering)**: Allows networking connection across two VPCs, enabling private traffic routing between them.

## Load Balancing:
- **[QUIC Protocol](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-quic-support-https-load-balancing)**: Modern transport protocol that reduces connection establishment time and is designed for multiplexed streams over UDP.
- **[Passthrough Load Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/passthrough-network-load-balancer)**: Directly forwards traffic to the backend instances without terminating the connection.


## Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):
- **[Node Pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-pools)**: A group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration.
- **[Regional vs Zonal Clusters](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/choosing-a-regional-vs-zonal-gke-cluster)**: Decision factors include availability, resilience, and Cost. Regional clusters are recommended for higher availability.
- **[kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)**: The API server that exposes the Kubernetes API.

## Infrastructure as Code:
- **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)**: Allows you to define and provision cloud infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.
