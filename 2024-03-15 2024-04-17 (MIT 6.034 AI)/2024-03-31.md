- **[MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)**: Advanced two lectures ahead and delved into genetic algorithms and sparse spaces:

    - **Genetic Algorithms**: An introduction to the mechanisms of genetic algorithms covering aspects such as fitness measurements, crossover techniques, mutation processes, and more. These evolutionary(pun intended) techniques simulate the process of natural selection to solve optimization and search problems.
    - **Sparse Spaces**: Using phonology as an example, this lecture provided insights into handling and leveraging sparse spaces within AI models and algorithms. 

- **Important Observation - Mechanism Envy**: A powerful note from Patrick Winston: It's the tendency to become overly attached to a  solution or technology and attempting to apply it universally. This phenomenon is a critical watch-out for AI engineers.
