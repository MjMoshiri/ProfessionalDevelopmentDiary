Lately, school work has kept me busy, especially with the focus on Signal Processing. I've been looking into different stages, including the basics of Signal Processing itself, as well as Video and Audio Processing. Additionally, I've been investigating how these can be implemented across various platforms.

On a different note, I've started working on my GitHub IO page. I'm using **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** for development and then plan to convert it to static HTML and CSS with `gh-pages`. A significant chunk of my learning from this project is centered around CSS since I want to design most of it myself. I've tackled subjects like CSS animations, `@keyframes`, `@media` queries, the `mask-image` property, and setting `max-width` based on character count.
