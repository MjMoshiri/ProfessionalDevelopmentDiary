- Continued my journey with the [MLOps course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-first-machine-operations-workflow/) on Microsoft Learn. üéâ Finished up modules 2, 3, and 4! Got the hang of setting things up in Azure Machine Learning, like workspaces and compute stuff. Plus, had some fun learning how to team up GitHub and Azure DevOps for smooth sailing with ML models. It's all about those actions and triggers!
You can check out the challange repo [here](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/mslearn-mlops) (Proabaly a good idea to check the commit history to see how I got things working). I'm going to keep adding to it as I go through the course. üòÅ
