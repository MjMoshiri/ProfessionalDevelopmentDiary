Today was an enriching day of exploration focused primarily on the UI layer of Android development. Here are the main areas I delved into:

- **State Management**: One of the key aspects of developing the UI is managing state. To gain a deeper understanding of this, I took a [codelab on Jetpack Compose State](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state) and watched a [video on the best practices for saving UI state on Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-s4z7B_Gnc). These resources provided valuable insights into how state can be managed effectively in Android.

- **ViewModel**: Next, I learned about ViewModel, a class designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. ViewModel allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. More about ViewModel can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

- **State Hoisting**: A concept closely related to state management in Jetpack Compose, state hoisting involves passing state up to higher-level composables, allowing them to control the state and propagate updates. This promotes a unidirectional data flow and makes state more predictable. You can read more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/state-hoisting).

- **Dependency Injection (DI) and Hilt**: I delved into Dependency Injection in Android and how to work with Hilt, a DI library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Hilt is recommended by Google as the standard DI solution for Android applications. Find more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

- **Work on SecondSight App**: I continued to work on the UI layer of my Time Tracker App, "SecondSight". There were many small challenges along the way, especially with implementing DI, but overcoming them was a great learning experience. Although it was a long day that ended at 6 in the morning, I was happy to come out stronger than the bugs! The current state of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight).
