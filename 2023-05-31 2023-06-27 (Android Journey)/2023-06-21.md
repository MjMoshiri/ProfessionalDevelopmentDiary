Today was focused on learning about the Context class in Android, preparing for app publishing on the Play Store, working on the SecondSight app, and learning about testing in Android. Here's what I learned:

- **[Context Class in Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context)**: I learned about the Context class in Android. Context is a handle to the system; it provides services like resolving resources, obtaining access to databases and preferences, and so on.

- **[Publishing an App on the Play Store](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859152?hl=en)**: I started learning about how to publish an app on the Play Store. This is a significant step as it will allow my app to reach a broader audience.

- **SecondSight App Progress**: I was mainly working on the SecondSight app in last days. The logic is almost done, and I just need to work on the UI a little bit more, and then it will be ready to be published. The project repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mjmoshiri/secondsight).
