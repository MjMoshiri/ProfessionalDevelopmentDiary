I have completed the first part of [*The Well-Grounded Java Developer*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-well-grounded-java/9781617298875/), which covers the Java changes from versions 8 to 17. I have now have a better insight into:

- **Modules:** Introduced in Java 9, modules provide a way to organize code and dependencies more effectively, promoting better encapsulation and code management.
- **Text Blocks:** A feature from Java 13, Text Blocks simplify the creation of multi-line string literals, making it easier to manage long strings directly in the code.
- **Records:** Introduced in Java 16, Records provide a concise syntax to declare classes that are mere data carriers, enhancing code readability.
- **New Switch Expressions:** Enhanced in Java 12 and 13, Switch Expressions streamline switch statements, making them more flexible and less error-prone.
- **Sealed Classes:** A feature from Java 15, Sealed Classes allow for more controlled inheritance, defining which other classes may extend or implement them.
