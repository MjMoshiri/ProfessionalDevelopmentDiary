A reflective note as the sixth semester comes to a close, marking the near end of my bachelor's journey and the anticipation of graduation. Despite the overwhelming schedule, encompassing a job, research, two major projects, and various courses, I've managed to secure significant learning achievements in recent months:

- **Audio and Video Processing Courses**: Successfully completed courses in both Audio and Video Processing, approached from a signal processing perspective. These courses offered in-depth insights into signal characteristics in media, noise management, feature identification, and established methods for effective processing.

- **In-depth IoT Exploration**:
    - **Work Experience**: My current job role has been instrumental in familiarizing me with IoT components and best practices.
    - **[Thesis Project](https://github.com/LiquidAI-project/wasm-comparison)**: Focused on benchmarking WebAssembly against native code on Raspberry Pi, furthering my knowledge in practical IoT applications.
    - **Microcontroller Project Course**: This course laid the foundational understanding of AVR programming, enhancing my hands-on skills in microcontroller technology.

- **[MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)**: Embarked on the MIT OpenCourseWare for Artificial Intelligence. Halfway through, this course has reinforced my understanding, especially in neural networks and deep learning, despite my prior familiarity with many of the topics discussed.

**Tags**: Signal Processing, IoT, AVR Programming, AI, Neural Networks, Deep Learning
