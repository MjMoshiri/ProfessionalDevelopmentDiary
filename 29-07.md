- **[Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)**: As a result of solving the leet-code [Soup Servings]((https://leetcode.com/problems/soup-servings/description/)) question, I learned about the Law of Large Numbers, a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.

- **Machine Learning Book Progress**: I continued reading the Mathematics For Machine Learning book and finished chapter 4 - Matrix Decompositions. I covered the following sections:
    - 4.5 Singular Value Decomposition
    - 4.6 Matrix Approximation
    - 4.7 Matrix Phylogeny
