Today was the first day in the journey of Data Sciense and a little bit of Algorithms:

- **[Red-Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)**: As a result of LeetCode Question of the day ([Path with Maximum Probability
](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)) I encounterd Red-Black Tree which is  a type of self-balancing binary search tree and I learned how to implement it.

- **Kaggle's Data Visualization Course**: Today, I started something I've always wanted to do - learning data visualization! I embarked on the [Kaggle's Data Visualization course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) and I've successfully completed it. This insightful course was a real eye-opener. I learned how to use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data. I now understand when and how to use a histogram, bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, heat map, and more. you can find the [final project notebook](<Source/Data Visualization Final Project.ipynb>) here.
