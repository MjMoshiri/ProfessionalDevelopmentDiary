A rewarding day with a successful LeetCode contest participation and further reading in the machine learning book. Here's what I did:

- **[LeetCode Biweekly Contest 109](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-109/)**: Participated in LeetCode Biweekly Contest 109 and successfully solved all four problems. 

- **Machine Learning Book Progress**: I continued reading the Mathematics For Machine Learning book and covered the following sections in chapter 4 - Matrix Decompositions:
    - 4.1 Determinant and Trace
    - 4.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
    - 4.3 Cholesky Decomposition
    - 4.4 Eigendecomposition and Diagonalization
