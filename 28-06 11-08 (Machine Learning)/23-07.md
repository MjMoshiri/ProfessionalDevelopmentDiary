Today was about improving efficiency and accuracy in my machine learning projects, I Worked on tuning the hyperparameters of my model to increase accuracy. I also learned about using parallelization techniques to speed up the process. These enhancements paid off with an improved Kaggle score of 0.79752 on Spaceship Titanic, which propelled my ranking from a 4-figure to a 3-figure rank! A huge leap forward!
