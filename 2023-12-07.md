I have taken on new roles as a researcher and design engineer, so I will be focusing my learning on materials related to those jobs going forward.

I have started reading ["WebAssembly: The Definitive Guide"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/webassembly-the-definitive/9781492089834/) and covered the first half, which included:

- **WebAssembly Modules**
- **WebAssembly Memory**
- **WebAssembly Tables**
- **Using C/C++ And WebAssembly**
- **Applied WebAssembly: Legacy Code In The Browser**
- **WebAssembly In The Server**
- **Applied WebAssembly: TensorFlow.Js**
