Today was about learning to debug databases in Android Studio and deep diving into various aspects of Jetpack Compose. Here's what I learned:

- **[Debugging Databases in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/inspect/database)**: I learned how to debug and inspect databases in Android Studio. This knowledge will be beneficial in diagnosing and solving any issues related to databases in my applications.

- **[Arrangement in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/Arrangement)**: I learned about Arrangement in Jetpack Compose Row and Column. Arrangement defines how space is distributed among the children of a Row or Column.

- **[Animation in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/introduction)**: I got introduced to the basics of animation in Jetpack Compose. It provides a simple and consistent way to animate UI changes.

- **[Icons in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/icons/package-summary)**: I learned about using icons and components in Jetpack Compose. Icons are an integral part of any app's UI and can significantly enhance the user experience.

- **[Drawers in Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/material#drawers)**: I learned about implementing drawers in Jetpack Compose. Drawers provide a handy way to house navigational components.

- **[SecondSight App](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight) Progress**: I applied all of the above learnings to the SecondSight app. This hands-on application of concepts helps in solidifying the understanding and getting comfortable with the tools and libraries.
