Today was about stepping into the world of Kaggle competitions and deepening my understanding of machine learning. Here's what I did:

- **[First Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/description)**: I started my first Kaggle competition today. The competition is based on the Titanic dataset, which is often used in machine learning.

- **[Guide to Perfect EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/computervisi/titanic-eda)**: I read the first guide on the Titanic Kaggle competition. The guide focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is a key step in understanding the data.

- **[Guide to Perfect Score on Titanic Kaggle Competition - Models](https://www.kaggle.com/code/computervisi/all-best-models)**: I also read another guide that focused on the models to use in the Kaggle competitions. Choosing the right model is crucial in getting accurate predictions.

- **[Mathematics For Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)**: I have started reading a book on the mathematics required for machine learning, and I have already finished the first chapter. While I do have some prior knowledge, it would be beneficial to refresh my memory and acquire new information. Understanding the mathematics behind the algorithms can assist in selecting the optimal algorithm and fine-tuning it for improved performance.
