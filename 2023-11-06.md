Recently, as I believe it's the proper time for me to learn the skills around research, I've been exploring the research world, diving into papers that explore the fascinating intersection of DevOps, IoT, and ML/AI. These topics, intricately intertwined with specialization and optimization layers, have captured my interest.

I'm fortunate to have access to Tampere University's research groups, and I'm in the process of finalizing arrangements to join them soon. I am excited to contribute, both as a way of giving back for the support they've provided and as a chance to collaborate on these exciting areas of study.
