### Object Detection Techniques
- **Sliding Window**
- **Bounding Box**: Defines the location of an object.
- [**Haar Wavelet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features): Used for object detection.
- [**AdaBoost**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost): An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
