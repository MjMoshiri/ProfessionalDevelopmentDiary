- Continued with the Go O'Reilly book, completing chapters 4, 5, and 6. Key takeaways include:
  - The constraints of `goto` and usage of `defer` in Go.
  - Deep dive into pointers in Go:
    - Small data structures (~100 bytes) are faster to return by value.
    - Large data structures (e.g., 10 MB) are faster to return by pointer.
    - CPU differences can alter the preferable size threshold for pointers vs values.
  - Insights into the Go Garbage Collector and techniques to minimize its workload.
  - Introduced to the `GOGC` and its impact on GC's CPU time consumption. Doubling the value of `GOGC` can reduce GC's CPU usage by half.
  - Learned about `GOMEMLIMIT` - a soft limit, its significance, and scenarios of application.
  - Furthre [GC Guide](https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide).
  - Gained insights into mechanical sympathy and the effect of RAM access on performance via [Memory Bandwidth Napkin Math](https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/memory-bandwidth-napkin-math/).

- Personal Reflection:
  - Deeply connected with the Go language; it feels like a natural fit.
