Today was another productive day focused on the Kaggle Titanic competition, feature engineering, model selection, and learning about linear algebra. Here's what I accomplished:

- **Kaggle Titanic Competition**: I continued working on the Kaggle Titanic competition, with a specific focus on feature engineering and model selection. I also spent time tuning hyperparameters to improve the model's performance. One resource that proved helpful was a guide titled ["How to Score Top 3% in Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster Competition"](https://anelmusic13.medium.com/how-to-score-top-3-in-kaggles-titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-competition-13d056e262b1). It provided a simple and intuitive approach to problem-solving and feature engineering for the competition.

- **Linear Algebra**: I studied the early pages of Chapter 2 of the "Mathematics for Machine Learning" book. This chapter covered linear algebra and served as a refresher for me. I revisited concepts such as matrices, vectors, linear equations, and methods to solve them. The book can be found [here](https://mml-book.github.io/).

- **[JetBrains DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/)**: I also dedicated some time to learning about JetBrains DataSpell, a tool that supports data science workflows. I explored how to use this tool effectively in my machine learning projects.
