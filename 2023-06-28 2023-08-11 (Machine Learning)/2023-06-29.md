Today was ammmaaazing! I gained a lot of new knowledge on composables, including hows and whens to recomposition , how to inspect them, and how to optimize the app.

Over the last 24 hours, I worked for 16 hours on various aspects of the app including UI, backend, notification, and architecture, and I'm really happy with the result.
