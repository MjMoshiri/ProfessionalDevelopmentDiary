I recognized a gap in my data cleaning skills and took the initiative to improve :

- **[Kaggle Data Cleaning Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning)**: While working on the Spaceship Titanic and Titanic competitions, I realized that my data cleaning skills needed enhancement. As a result, I started the Data Cleaning course on Kaggle.

- **Scaling and Normalization**: Studied about two important pre-processing steps in machine learning and how they could be useful for some algorithms(e.g., KNN, Neural Networks)- [Feature Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) and [Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)). These methods are used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data.

- **[Box–Cox Transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform#Box%E2%80%93Cox_transformation)**: I learned about Box–Cox transformations, which are used to stabilize variance and make a dataset more closely align with the normal distribution.It's used in scipy.stats.boxcox() for normalizing data.
