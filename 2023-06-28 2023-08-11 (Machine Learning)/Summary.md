# My Machine Learning Journey

In my journey through the realm of **Machine Learning**, I've delved into numerous crucial areas. These encompass both the theoretical and practical aspects of ML.
here is a summary of the topics I learned in the past 40 days.

## Models
I've explored various ML models, understanding their unique characteristics and applications.

## Mathematics
The core of ML lies in mathematics. I've gained a deep understanding of the mathematical principles that power these models.

## Training & Optimization
The effectiveness of an ML model is determined by how well it's trained. I've learned techniques to train models and optimize their performance.

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Understanding data before diving into modeling is crucial. Through EDA, I've learned to summarize, visualize, and interpret data.

## Data Visualization
Visualization plays a pivotal role in comprehending and representing data. It's a tool that I've honed over time.

## Data Cleaning
Dirty data can derail the best models. I've practiced various techniques to ensure data cleanliness and quality.

## Feature Engineering
Manipulating and transforming features can drastically improve model performance. I've explored numerous strategies to engineer and select the best features for models.

## Libraries
Throughout this journey, I've utilized several libraries relevant to the aforementioned topics. Some notable ones include:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for modeling and feature engineering
- `statsmodels` for statistical modeling
- `xgboost` for gradient boosting
- `tensorflow` and `keras` for deep learning
- `catboost` for categorical boosting
- ...and more!
