## Major Things to Avoid During Disagreements

1. **Criticism**:
   - Example: "We have this bug we need to address." "You know what I don’t like? The fact that you leave all these dirty dishes around the house!" Focus on the issue, not unrelated complaints.

2. **Contempt**:
   - Example: "We have this bug." "I don’t like your face." Avoid personal insults and the intention to demean.

3. **Defensiveness**:
   - Example: "We have this bug." "That’s not a bug!" Defensive responses block progress.

4. **Stonewalling**:
   - Example: "We have this bug." "" (404 Not Found!) Refusing to engage hinders resolution.

## Mapping Relationship Issues to Business

- **Fundraising / Runway (Money)**: CFO
- **Customers / Employees (Kids)**: Support / HR
- **Performance (Sex)**: CTO / COO / Sales
- **Roadmap (Time)**: CEO / CPO
- **Competition (Jealousy)**: CEO
- **Partnerships (In-Laws)**: Biz Dev / CEO


### Success and Failure
Define what success and failure mean in each area and how/when to address them.

## Handling Disagreements
Use the following format:
```
When [observation], I feel [emotion] because I'm needing some [universal needs]. Would you be able to [request]?
```
1. **Observation** (No Evaluation): "Your last document has 3 numerical mistakes" (Not: "You are clumsy").
2. **Emotions** (No Thoughts): "I feel frustrated" (Not: "I think you aren’t taking this seriously"). If replacing 'feel' with 'think' still makes sense, it's a thought, not an emotion.
3. **Complex Emotions**: Certain emotional expressions may harbor underlying feelings that require careful attention. For example: Feeling Blamed (Scared), 
Judged (Resentful), Misunderstood (Frustrated), Rejected (Hurt). [Full List](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/evaluative-words-list-nonviolent-communication/10628168).
4.  **Request vs. Demand**: Distinguish between universal needs (e.g., "I need support") and personal demands ("I need support from you").

## Level 3 Conversations

- Ensure clarity on responsibilities.
- Agree on whether current divisions make sense.
- Implement a feedback mechanism to address issues.
