**[YC School Course: Startup Knowledge](https://www.ycombinator.com/)**: Completed Module 3: Building Your Founding Team. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Sharing Equity Equally**: As a CEO, being generous with equity is crucial. If you can't be generous with someone, reconsider whether they're the right person to work with.

- **Look for people first, then skills**: Skills can be learned, but personalities are harder to change. Look for people you enjoy working with and whom you trust.

- **Important Initial Topics**:
  - Work commitment to the startup
  - Definitions of availability
  - Duration without benefits
  - Investing time to understand cofounders' personalities and having open discussions about:
    - Motivations
    - Stress responses
    - Communication preferences for expressing concerns
    - Reactions to suggestions
  
- **Handling Disagreements**: Recognize that tough decisions, disagreements, and arguments will occur. Learning how to respect each other is essential, and there should be a respected final decision-maker.

- **Things to Avoid**:
  - Blaming
  - Micromanagement
  - Delaying difficult conversations
