**[YC School Course: Startup Knowledge](https://www.ycombinator.com/)**: Began the course to further develop the posture-fixing startup idea. Completed Module 1: Deciding to start a startup. Here are 5 key takeaways:
  
- **Lifestyle Commitment**: This is truly a lifestyle and that cannot be emphasized enough, so know what you are signing up for. Every aspect of life is affected by it. Here, success comes with a trade-off of workaholism, uncertainty, giving up the default mode, and never-ending stress. However, if you have the mentality, almost nothing should discourage you from moving toward it. It's extremely rewarding; even if you don't become a millionaire, you will learn skills that you can't get otherwise.
  
- **Team Over Ideas**: It's honestly not about the idea as much as it's about the team. So, put value in finding the right people, connections, and mindsets.
  
- **Understanding Users**: The key to winning is knowing the users and having something they love using. If you have that, you can make money out of it one way or another (solve real problems).
  
- **Be Prepared for the Counterintuitive**: Be prepared for counterintuitive.
  
- **Continuous Learning**: Never stop learning. Being at the edge of something, you know things that are possible before others do, and that gives you an advantage by default.
