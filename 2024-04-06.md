- **[MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)**: 
    - **Boosting**: It's a technique designed to improve the accuracy of predictive models. Boosting helps in combining multiple weak learners to create a strong learner, enhancing the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
    - **Representations: Classes, Trajectories, Transitions**: Dived into the ways AI can represent complex information. This includes the use of classes for categorization, trajectories for understanding paths through space or states over time, and transitions for modeling changes between states. 
    - **Architectures: GPS, SOAR, Subsumption, Society of Mind**: Explored various AI architectures that provide frameworks for building intelligent systems. GPS (General Problem Solver) and SOAR (cognitive architecture for constructing general intelligent systems) were discussed, along with the Subsumption architecture (which focuses on building AI based on layered sets of behaviors) and the Society of Mind theory (proposing that intelligence arises from the interactions of simple agents).
