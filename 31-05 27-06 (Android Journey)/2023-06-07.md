Today, my learning was mainly centered around Jetpack Compose. Here's what I delved into:

- **Navigation in Jetpack Compose**: Navigation between different screens is a core component of any app. Today, I learned about how navigation is handled in Jetpack Compose through a [codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-navigation). It provided hands-on experience with setting up navigation graphs, passing arguments between composable functions, and more.

- **Jetpack Compose Best Practices**: To ensure I'm developing in line with best practices, I reviewed a guide on [Jetpack Compose best practices](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/kotlin). This guide contains valuable tips on writing idiomatic Kotlin code in Jetpack Compose.

- **Components of Compose**: I spent some time understanding the components of Jetpack Compose, focusing on layouts and material components. These are essential building blocks for creating an Android UI. You can learn more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layouts/material).

- **Work on SecondSight App**: I continued to enhance the UI layer of my Time Tracker App, "SecondSight", with the new knowledge I gained about Jetpack Compose. You can see the current state of the project [here](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/ProfessionalDevelopmentDiary).

- **Understanding LiveData**: LiveData is an observable data holder class that's lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities and fragments. LiveData makes it easier to keep your UI in sync with changing data. I recommend exploring LiveData as it's a crucial concept in Android development. You can learn more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata).
