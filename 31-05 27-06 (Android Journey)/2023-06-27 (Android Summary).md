Today was about finalizing the [SecondSight](https://github.com/mjmoshiri/SecondSight) app project and reflecting on my journey of Android development. 

I have worked on finalizing the SecondSight app project and I can now leave it for good. The journey of Android development was fun, insightful, and challenging. I have learned a lot and I am looking forward to learning more if there comes an opportunity.

Although I was familiar with Java and OOP, it was nice to see how Kotlin is more concise and easy to use. Using the MVVM architecture was easy and intuitive and I can see how it can be used in other projects. Furthermore, I knew about Gradle but this gave me an opportunity to learn more about it and how to use it to build and run an actual app.

I have also learned basic and some of advanced Android development concepts of:

- MVVM
- Jetpack Compose
- Responsive Design, Constraint Layout, and Material Design
- Fragments, Activities, and Views
- Navigation Component
- Repository Pattern
- Dependency Injection
- Notifications and Permissions
- Kotlin Coroutines
- LiveData
- Room Database
- CatLog, Debugging, and Logging
- KSP, KAPT, and Annotation Processing

With this month of learning, I am really satisfied with my Android development skills and I feel ready to move to the next step.
