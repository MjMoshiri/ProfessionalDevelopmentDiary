Today was mostly about moving the App repository to [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) and using [DAOs](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data) to access the database. I had to refactor a lot of code to make it work, but it was worth it. 

Here's what I learned:

- **[Room Database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)**: Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. Room manages tedious tasks that you used to handle with a database helper class, including SQLiteOpenHelper.

- **[DAOs in Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data)**: A data access object (DAO) validates your SQL at compile-time and associates it with a method. In your Room DAO, you can define methods to perform database operations, such as inserting, deleting, and querying rows.

- **[Annotations in Room](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/persistence/room/package-summary#annotations)**: I learned about the different annotations in Room and how to use them. These include @Entity for tables, @Dao for data access objects, @Query for SQL queries, etc.

- **[Queries in Room](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/persistence/room/Query)**: I learned about the different types of queries in Room and how to use them. These include basic CRUD operations, complex queries using @Query, etc.

- **[TypeConverters in Room](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/persistence/room/TypeConverter)**: I learned about TypeConverters in Room, which allow you to store custom objects in the database. More about TypeConverters can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/referencing-data).

- **[Relationships in Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/relationships)**: I learned about how to create relationships between entities in Room. 

- **[SDK Extensions](https://developer.android.com/guide/sdk-extensions)**: I also learned about SDK extensions, which are libraries that extend the Android SDK. I learned about the different types of extensions and how to use them.
