Today's learning journey continued with further exploration of Android development and Kotlin. Here's what I dived into:

- **Compose Preview**: A fundamental part of Jetpack Compose, [Compose Preview](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling/previews) enables developers to preview the UI directly in the IDE without needing to run the entire application. This is a great productivity boost, making UI development faster and more efficient.

- **Flow in Kotlin**: Kotlin Flow is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous streams of data in a Kotlin program. It's part of the Kotlin coroutines API and provides a way to handle sequences of values over time. I explored the basics of Flow in Kotlin, and you can find more about it [here](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/).

- **Time Tracker App**: To apply the knowledge I'm gaining, I've started building a time tracker app named "SecondSight". This minimal to-do app serves as a practical project where I can implement the concepts and tools I'm learning about. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight).

- **Now in Android Project Architecture**: To understand real-world examples of Android project architecture, I studied the architecture of the "Now in Android" project on GitHub. This project provides excellent insights into how a well-structured Android app is organized and how the various components interact with each other. The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/blob/main/docs).
