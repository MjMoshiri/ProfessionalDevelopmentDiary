Today's learning focused on various aspects of Android development. Here's what I've learned:

- **Notifications in Android**: I started learning about notifications in Android, specifically how to build and issue them. Notifications are a key way to provide timely and relevant information to your users, even when your app is not running in the foreground. More about it [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/build-notification).

- **ViewModelProvider**: I dug into ViewModelProvider, a utility class that provides ViewModels for a scope. This is a key component of the related to the notification functionality I am adding to my [SecondSight](https://github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight) app. You can learn more about ViewModelProvider [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/ViewModelProvider).

- **Foreground Services in Android**: I learned about foreground services and how to use them. Foreground services perform operations that are noticeable to the user, even when the user is not interacting with the app. You can learn more about foreground services [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services).

- **WorkManager in Android**: WorkManager is a part of Android Jetpack that makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts. This could be extremely useful for tasks like periodic syncing of data, uploading logs, or a variety of other tasks that are essential to the app but not user-facing. You can learn more about WorkManager [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager).
