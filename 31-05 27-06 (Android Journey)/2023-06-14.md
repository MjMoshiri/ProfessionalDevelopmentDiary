Today was filled with further exploration of Android's Jetpack Compose, learning about effective Android documentation, and starting to work with Room, a persistence library. Here's the rundown:

- **Lifecycle of a Compose App**: I delved into the lifecycle of a Compose app. This knowledge is crucial for effective state management with view models. More details can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle).

- **Side Effects in Compose**: I learned about side effects in Compose, functions that are invoked in composable functions to interact with the outside world. These side effects helped me correctly update the state of the app in my project, [SecondSight](https://www.github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight). Learn more about it [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects).

- **Effective Documentation for Android Apps**: Documentation is an integral part of the development process. It's especially important when working in a collaborative environment. I learned how to make effective documentation for Android apps from this insightful [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-make-effective-documentation-android-apps-sara-meloni/).

- **Room Persistence Library**: Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, enabling robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. I started learning about Room to move the [SecondSight](https://www.github.com/MjMoshiri/SecondSight) app to a more robust database. Learn more about Room [here](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room).

- **Accessibility in Android Apps**: To make an Android app usable by as many people as possible, it's important to consider accessibility features. I started learning about how to make Android apps more accessible from this [guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/apps).
