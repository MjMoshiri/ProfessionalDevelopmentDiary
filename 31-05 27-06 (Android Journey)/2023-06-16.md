Today was about diving deeper into coroutines, specifically for database implementation. Here's what I learned:

- **[Coroutines in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines)**: I learned more about coroutines as they were needed for database implementation. Coroutines are a great tool to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise block the main thread.

- **[Dispatchers in Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-adv)**: I learned about dispatchers and how they can be used to define the thread on which a coroutine will run.

- **[withContext in Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-adv#main-safety)**: I understood the usage of withContext in coroutines. It is used to change the context of a coroutine.

- **[Coroutines in ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines/coroutines-adv#perf)**: I learned how to add coroutines in ViewModel to make it non-blocking. This will help in improving the performance of the app.

- **[LeetCode Question of the Day](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reorder-array-to-get-same-bst/)**: The problem was interesting and taught me a new mathematical concept.the [ModInverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) is a mathematical concept that I learned about today. It is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number in a finite field. It was used in the solution to the problem above to find the number of ways to reorder an array to get the same BST. The solution can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reorder-array-to-get-same-bst/solutions/3645639/go-22ms-solution/).
