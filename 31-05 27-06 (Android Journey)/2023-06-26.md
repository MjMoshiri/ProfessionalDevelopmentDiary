Today was about exploring the concept of flows in Kotlin and syncing different parts of the SecondSight app. Here's what I learned:

- **[Using Flows in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)**: I learned about using flows for data streams and repositories in Kotlin. Flows provide a way to handle streams of values that are computed asynchronously.

- **[Collecting Data from Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow#collect)**: I learned how to collect data from flows. The collect operator is used to collect the values emitted by the flow.

- **[SecondSight App](https://github.com/mjmoshiri/secondsight)**: I fine-tuned the app and worked on syncing different parts of the app UI.
