# Professional Development Diary

Welcome to my Professional Development Diary!

This repository is a log diary where I document every step of my learning journey. It encapsulates the knowledge I gain, and the milestones I achieve along the way. I try to explore topics I am curious about, learn new skills, and possibly even discover new passions.  

I hope this repository will not only serve as a chronicle of my personal and professional evolution but also inspire others to embrace learning and growth amidst life's transitions.

## Learning in Progress

- [Startup Science](./Startup/) -  Entries documenting my learnings on how to build a successful startup. 
- [Ruby](./Ruby/) -  Learning Ruby's syntax, features, and best practices. Currently reading [Pickaxe Book - Programming Ruby 3.3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-ruby-3-3/9798888650684/)

##  Previous Learning Journeys

- [AI Engineering](./AI%20Engineering/) - I learned how to build, deploy, and scale AI models in production by completing the [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](./AI%20Engineering/Certificates/IBM%20AI%20Engineering.pdf) and more advanced and practical topics, such as Quantization.
- [MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](./2024-03-15%202024-04-17%20(MIT%206.034%20AI)/) - This course covers a wide range of topics in AI, including search algorithms, neural networks, genetic algorithms.
- [Machine Learning](./2023-06-28%202023-08-11%20(Machine%20Learning)/) - I had some prior experience in Machine Learning, but I wanted to learn more about the field and gain hands-on experience in building and deploying models as well as understanding the underlying math and theory. If you're interested in a Summary, you can find it [here](./2023-06-28%202023-08-11%20(Machine%20Learning)/Summary.md)
- [Modern C++](./Modern%20C%2B%2B/) -  Refreshing my C++ knowledge, learning about the latest features in C++20, best practices, and industry standards in modern C++ development.
- [Clouds](./Clouds/) -  Entries documenting my learnings on cloud technologies, architecture, and engineering. I learned key points for GCP Cloud Core Structure and Scalings. The folder also contains related certifications gained during the learning process.
- [Android Development](./2023-05-31%202023-06-27%20(Android%20Journey)/) - I began this journey with no prior experience in Android development and over a few weeks learned Jetpack Compose, Room, Coroutines, LiveData, view binding, MVVM architecture, and how to build a modern Android app. If you're interested in a summary, you can find it [here](./2023-05-31%202023-06-27%20(Android%20Journey)/2023-06-27%20(Android%20Summary).md)
- [Semster 5 Activities](./2023-08-12%202024-01-09%20(Semster%205)/) -  Topics include MLOps, Kubernetes, Go, WebAssembly, web development, refining Java skills, and Mathematics for Machine Learning.
