# Professional Development Diary

Welcome to my Professional Development Diary!

This repository is a log diary where I document every step of my learning journey. It encapsulates the knowledge I gain, the challenges I encounter, and the milestones I achieve along the way. I try to explore topics I am curious about, learn new skills, and possibly even discover new passions.  

I hope this repository will not only serve as a chronicle of my personal and professional evolution but also inspire others to embrace learning and growth amidst life's transitions.

## Learning in Progress

- [Startup Science](./Startup/) - This folder contains entries documenting my learnings on how to build a successful startup. I believe that eventually, I will start my own company, and now is the time to learn how to do it. 
- [AI Engineering](./AI%20Engineering/) - This folder contains entries documenting my learnings on AI Engineering. I am learning how to build, deploy, and scale AI models in production, following the [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer).
##  Other Repository Contents

- [Android Development](./2023-05-31%202023-06-27%20(Android%20Journey)/) - This folder contains a series of entries documenting my journey in learning Android development. I started this journey with no prior experience in Android development, and by the end of it, I had built a fully functional Android app. If you're interested in a Summary of my Android journey, you can find it [here](./2023-05-31%202023-06-27%20(Android%20Journey)/2023-06-27%20(Android%20Summary).md)
- [Machine Learning](./2023-06-28%202023-08-11%20(Machine%20Learning)/) - This folder contains a series of entries documenting my journey in learning Machine Learning. I had some prior experience in Machine Learning, but I wanted to learn more about the field and gain hands-on experience in building and deploying models as well as understanding the underlying math and theory. If you're interested in a Summary of my Machine Learning journey, you can find it [here](./2023-06-28%202023-08-11%20(Machine%20Learning)/Summary.md)
- [Semster 5 Activities](./2023-08-12%202024-01-09%20(Semster%205)/) - This folder contains entries about various things I learned during Semester 5 of my bachelor's studies. Topics include MLOps, Kubernetes, Go, WebAssembly, web development, refining Java skills, and Mathematics for Machine Learning.
- [MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence Course](./2024-03-15%202024-04-17%20(MIT%206.034%20AI)/) - This folder contains entries documenting my progress through the MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence course. This course covers a wide range of topics in AI, including search algorithms, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and more.
- [Clouds](./Clouds/) - This folder contains entries documenting my learnings on cloud technologies, architecture, and engineering. I learned key points for GCP Cloud Core Structure and Scalings. The folder also contains related certifications gained during the learning process.

In the future, I may add more documents to this repository. Any new additions will be listed here for quick and easy access.
